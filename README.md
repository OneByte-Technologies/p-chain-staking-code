# Flare P-chain Staking Tool

This repo contains a tool for staking assets.

Because Flare is a fork of [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform), like Avalanche, it has three chains:

- C-chain: contract chain, executes EVM smart contracts that manage assets (like ERC-20 tokens).
- P-chain: platform chain, coordinates validators.
- X-chain: exchange chain, handles assets.

When validators require tokens to work (for example, as stake in proof-of-stake systems), these assets need to be moved from the C-chain to the P-chain.
This tool also supports moving assets between the C- and P-chains and back.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the tool.
We recommend using `npm` unless you plan to contribute to this repository.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @flarenetwork/flare-stake-tool --global
```

If you experience permissions issues, try:

```bash
sudo npm install @flarenetwork/flare-stake-tool --global
```

### Manually building the repository

1. Clone this repository by running

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/p-chain-staking-code.git
   ```

2. Run `yarn` inside the cloned repo folder.

3. Run `yarn build`.

4. Follow the rest of this guide from the repo folder using `bin/flare-stake-tool` instead of just `flare-stake-tool`.

## Set up your private/public key

To use this app in a less-secure manner you can set your private key as an environment variable.
In this case the signing is done within the app. For a more secure approach, you can log your
public key into the app and sign transaction hashes offline with ECDSA over the curve secp256k1.

> **WARNING:**
> You are about to write your staking account's **private key** into a **plain text file**.
> The following operations should be performed on a **secure** machine, ideally not the validator node.
> For added security, store the private key file in a removable storage device, plugged in only when needed.

1. Obtain the private key (either a length 64 hexadecimal or [cb58 format](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4587395-what-is-cb58)),
or the public key (prefixed `0x02`, `0x03` or `0x04` or ethereum-specific format `X  Y`, where `X` and `Y` are 32-byte hexadecimal numbers)
2. Create a file to hold your key.
3. Paste this code in as follows and enter either the hex/cb58 private key or the public key within the quotation marks:

   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY_CB58 = "private key"
   PRIVATE_KEY_HEX = "private key"
   PUBLIC_KEY = "public key"
   ```

## Operations with private key

These are the operations you can perform with this tool, when you log in with your private key.

### Address conversion

Convert the private key to P-chain and C-chain addresses to import and export them safely, without exposing a private key.
The public key is derived from the private key and the P- and C-chain addresses are derived from the public key.
To get the derived P- and C-chain addresses, along with the associated public key, use:

```bash
flare-stake-tool info addresses --env-path <path to your private key file>
```

Where:

- `env-path` is the path to the file where you stored the private key.

By default the tool connects to the Flare network. You can add `--network costwo` to connect to Coston2, or `--network localflare` to connect to a node running on the same machine.

Sample response:

The X-, P-, and C-chain addresses are returned, along with the public key.
There is no standard address format for the X- and P-chains, but itâ€™s usually Bech32.
On the C-chain, the Ethereum format is normally used to comply with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

```bash
X-chain address: X-flare1pynhfl09rfrf20s83lf6ra5egqylmx757ahxn6
P-chain address: P-flare1pynhfl09rfrf20s83lf6ra5egqylmx757ahxn6
C-chain address hex: 0xead9c93b79ae7c1591b1fb5323bd777e86e150d4
secp256k1 public key: 0x02efe41c5d213089cb7a9e808505e9084bb9eb2bf3aa8050ea92a5ae9e20e5a692
```

### Export and import assets

#### Move assets from the C-chain to the P-chain

Funds typically reside on the C-chain account, so they have to be exported from it.
Exported funds must then be imported to the corresponding P-chain account.

This requires one transaction on each chain so you need to issue two commands:

```bash
flare-stake-tool crosschain exportCP -a <amount> -f <fee> --env-path <path to your private key file>
flare-stake-tool crosschain importCP --env-path <path to your private key file>
```

Where:

- `amount` is the amount to export, in FLR.
- `fee` is optional. It specifies a gas fee for a transaction in FLR.
- `env-path` is the path to the file where you stored your private key.

> **Note:**
> Methods affecting the P-chain (`importCP` and `exportPC`) always use a fixed gas fee of 0.001FLR, while methods affecting the C-chain (`exportCP` and `importPC`) have variable gas fees and can thus be either set or calculated automatically.
If you get the `errInsufficientFunds` error, try specifying a higher gas fee when exporting funds.

Sample response:

```bash
Used fee of .000280750
Success! TXID: 2i5zkusqNou8irBKeJQkYVXp72ZVFeXYhKDdN1S3zCUy35vNAb
Success! TXID: xNThCnRNMTGnZy8PZgdoyEpTTnRKMBLFfEgH27FzQCFHv79ra
```

#### Move assets from the P-chain back to the C-chain

> **IMPORTANT:**
> These commands are similar to exporting and importing assets from the C-chain to the P-chain, but they are not the same.
Note the reversed P and C.

```bash
flare-stake-tool crosschain exportPC -a <amount> --env-path <path to your private key file>
flare-stake-tool crosschain importPC -f <fee> --env-path <path to your private key file>
```

where `amount` and `fee` are optional.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Omitting `amount` exports all funds from the P-chain.

> **Note:**
> Methods affecting the P-chain (`importCP` and `exportPC`) always use a fixed gas fee of 0.001FLR, while methods affecting the C-chain (`exportCP` and `importPC`) have variable gas fees and can thus be either set or calculated automatically.
If you get the `errInsufficientFunds` error, try specifying a higher gas fee when exporting funds.

### Staking

```bash
flare-stake-tool stake -n <nodeId> -s <start-time> -e <end-time> -a <amount> --env-path <path to your private key file>
```

Where:
- `nodeId` is the ID of the node being deployed as a validator.
- `start-time` is the unix time of the start of the staking process.
- `end-time` is the unix time of the end of the staking process.
- `amount` is the amount to export and stake in FLR. The minimum is 2000 FLR and the maximum is 10000 FLR.
- `env-path` is the path to the file where you stored your private key.
- `network` is the network to stake on. It defaults and should always be the Flare network, except when testing.

The funds on the P-chain account are available to start staking to the validator nodes.

When the staking period ends, the nodes automatically stop acting as validators and the staked amount is returned to the C-chain account or you can move them back before the end of the staking period.

To check whether a validator has been added successfully, fetch lists of both pending and current validators with this command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool info validators
```

## Operations with public key

These are the operations you can perform with this tool, when you log in with your public key.

### Exporting from C-chain to P-chain through raw signing

When using the app with public key only, you can export funds from the C-chain to the P-chain by signing a raw transaction.
Here the export is split in two steps:
- obtain the hashes with signer addresses along with the serialized transaction,
- externally sign the hashes and send the signatures back to the app to finalize the export.

To obtain the signed hashes, use the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool crosschain exportCP -a <amount> --get-hashes --env-path <path to your public key file>
```

This will output a list of `(hash, signer address)` along with the serialized transaction.
> **Note:**
> If you are not using multisig, there should always be only one unique pair of a hash and signer address.
To finalize the transaction with hash signatures, use the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool crosschain exportCP -a <amount> -tx <serialized transaction> -sg <signed hashes> --use-signatures --env-path <path to your private key file>
```

The procedure is similar with importing to P-chain and staking there.
